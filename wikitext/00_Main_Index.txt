== Scope ==
This project maps every descriptor in the '''[[Medical Subject Headings]]''' (MeSH) vocabulary — the [[National Library of Medicine]]'s authoritative controlled vocabulary for biomedical literature — to its corresponding '''Wikipedia article''' and '''[[Wikidata]] item'''. The goal is to identify coverage gaps: MeSH terms that should have a Wikipedia article but currently do not.

MeSH descriptors have been filtered to exclude purely systematic chemical names and publication-type entries, then classified into clinical and scientific topics. Each term is linked to its [[Wikidata]] item via property [[d:Property:P486|P486]] (MeSH descriptor ID).

== How to use this project ==
Each subpage lists MeSH descriptors in that area, sorted alphabetically within each topic. Terms that link to an existing Wikipedia article appear as [[bluelink]]s; terms without an article appear as [[redlink]]s. Each entry also includes a link to the corresponding [[Wikidata]] item and the MeSH descriptor ID.

; Entry format
: <code><nowiki>* [[Article Title]] — [[d:Q12345|Q12345]] <small>(MeSH: D000001)</small></nowiki></code>

; How you can help

* Pick a topic area from the [[#Subpage index|subpage index]] below
* Look for redlinks — these are MeSH-recognized concepts without a Wikipedia article
* Click the Wikidata link to check for articles in other languages that could be translated
* Create a stub or redirect for terms that can be covered by an existing article
* Add {{tl|MeSH name}} or {{tl|Medical resources}} to articles that don't yet have them

== Data sources ==
* '''MeSH descriptors''' are obtained from the [https://nlmpubs.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mesh/MESH_FILES/xmlmesh/ NLM MeSH XML download].
* '''Topic classification''' is derived from MeSH tree numbers. Each descriptor's primary tree number prefix (2nd level) maps to a clinical or scientific topic.
* '''Wikidata matching''' uses [[d:Property:P486|P486]] (MeSH descriptor ID) to link each term to its Wikidata item.
